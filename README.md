# OpenCV Benchmarking

## Usage
1. Make a directory where the OpenCV builds are stored.
2. Run ```sudo python3 benchmark.py [# of executions]```
   
   For example, to run the test program 200 times for each build, do:
   
    ```sudo python3 benchmark.py 200```

The benchmark results are saved in a CSV file after all the executions have finished.
